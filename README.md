Introduction
===========================

EmaratCoin is a private, secure, untraceable currency. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers.

Privacy:
EmaratCoin uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

Security: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 24 word mnemonic that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of certain types of cryptography, EmaratCoin is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

EmaratCoin is a PoS & PoW (Hybrid) based cryptocurrency on scrypt Algorithem. The Emarat Coin is a Superior Distributed Decentralized Ledger Blockchain Technology to serve as a digital-age payment system. EmaratCoin is the future of decentralized economy of world specially Middle East and Asia. A decentralized system using SDDL Blockchain Technology which is 100x powerful than bitcoin, specially formulated on Scrypt Hybrid (PoS & PoW) Algorithm that allows to earn more through trading, staking, lending & mining. Emarat Coin is a decentralized electronic currency developed in 2017 by successful financial experts. It is not “owned” by any group or business or individual. The Emarat Coin is controlled directly by the individual owners themselves, a system known as peer-to-peer (P2P). Emarat Coin is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. AEC will initially focus on the remittance, trading, staking markets currently dominated by large players. Emarat Coin (AEC) is the first consumer-oriented innovative cryptocurrency on blockchain technology launched in United Arab Emirates by the group of successful financial experts and investors. The purpose of EmaratCoin is to serve as a digital-age payment system, evolving one step at a time into an independent money to complete with that forced on us by the states. People will be able to pay through Emarat Coin in the local markets as well.


Development process
===========================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of EmaratCoin.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.
